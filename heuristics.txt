Vampire-Werewolf heuristic is the number of vampire and werewolves that are in their final position (East or west side).
This heuristic evaluation does not overestimate the states cost and results in the optimal path from the
start state to the goal state. Because we only consider legal moves, we can be certain that of any legal moves,
it will result in a next state that is the minimum available path.

Sliding tile puzzle heuristic is the manhattan distance that each number is from its goal state. 
This heuristic does not overestimate the cost because each tile is represented with the minimal distance
to its goal state.
